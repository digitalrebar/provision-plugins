  This parameter lets the bioscfg command know what tooling it should use
  to get and set BIOS configuration values on a machine.  The current options are :

  * ``dell`` which will use ``racadm`` to get and set BIOS settings via ``racadm get``.
  * ``hp`` which will use ``conrep`` to get and set BIOS settings.
  * ``lenovo`` which will use ``onecli`` to get and set BIOS via ``onecli config``.
  * ``supermicro`` whicl will use ``sum`` to get and set BIOS settings.
  * ``none`` which does nothing.

  Support for other BIOS configuration tooling is welcome.
Schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - dell
    - hp
    - lenovo
    - supermicro
    - none
