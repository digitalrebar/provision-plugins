Name: ble/custom-report-fields
Description: Set optional Report meta data fields.
Documentation: |
  This Param allows the operator to set custom Report meta data fields
  for the generated Reports.  The values that can be set are:

    * ``name`` - the field name to display in the report
    * ``value`` - the value of the named field for the report

  These values are written in to the Blancco LUN Eraser ``config.txt`` file.
  Fields can only be named ``customN``; where *N* **must** be a sequencially
  increasing integer.

  This Param uses an Object structure that follows the ``customN`` naming
  convention in the field, where ``customN`` is the index in the Object to
  obtain the field ``name`` and ``value`` data from.

  Example in YAML:

    ::

      custom1:
        name: "Ticket"
        value: "OPS-1234"
      custom2:
        name: "AuthorizedBy"
        value: "Mr. Bigwig"

  .. warning:: There MUST NOT be any gaps in sequencial numbering of the
               field values.  The operator MUST specify a properly ascending
               order of 'custom' fields, no internal validations are performed.
               Failure to do so will result in the Reports not being uploaded
               correctly to the Blancco Management Console service.

  Any number of custom fields may be created and used as long as the numbers
  are sequentially incrementing.  This Param limits the number of custom
  fields possible to 99 (eg ``custom1`` to ``custom99``).
