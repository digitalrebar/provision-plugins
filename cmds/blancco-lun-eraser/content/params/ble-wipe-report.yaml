Name: ble/wipe-report
Description: Automatically written with the BLE Wipe Report when completed.
Documentation: |
  This Param will automatically be written on the Machine Object when
  a successful completed wipe process of the Blancco LUN Eraser (BLE) tool
  has completed.

  On subsequent re-runs of the software, the Param value will be overwritten.
  The reports are also uploaded and managed in the Blancco Management Console,
  which is defined by the Param ``ble/license-server``.

  Currently the report is written as raw XML format, as produced by the BLE
  tooling.
