Name: ble/wipe-report-profile-tag
Description: A partial tag used for the Profile name for multi-Machine Wipe Reports.
Documentation: |
  The Blancco LUN Eraser tool generates an individual wipe report for each
  Machine that runs the tooling.  In addition, multiple Machines wiped at
  once can record the Wipe Report to a single Profile.  This allows collection
  of a large fleet of wipe reports via a single query.

  Note that it is the Operator's responsibility to coordinate which Machines
  simultaneously run a Wipe operation, and subsequently query the Profile after
  all machines have completed.

  Future features may include a Context coordinator that can handle this process.

  This Params specifies only a portion (eg the ``tag``) for the Profile name
  that will be used.  If this Param is set to ``purple``, then the Profile
  name that will be generated and used to record the Wipe Reports will be:

    * ``ble/wipe-report-purple``

  If this Param has no value set, then no aggregate Profile wipe report
  will be generated.

  .. note:: The value of this Param must be the same on all Machines for
            which you want to aggregate Wipe Reports to.
