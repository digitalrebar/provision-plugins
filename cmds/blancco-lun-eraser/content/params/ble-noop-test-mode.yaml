Name: ble/noop-test-mode
Description: Sets the BLE tooling to not excute the wipe tools.  For debugging.
Documentation: |
  This param prevents the Blancco LUN Eraser tooling from actually executing
  the destructive wipe tooling (``BlanccoLUNEraser``).

  This is primarily used as a debugging mode.  Setting this Param will prevent
  the binary from executing.  It also prevents any of the Report scraping and
  Param writing commands from running.
