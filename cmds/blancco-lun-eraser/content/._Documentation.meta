Blancco LUN Eraser
------------------

This plugin implements the commercially licensed industrial grade Disk
and LUN wiping tool from Blancco.  The tool requires additional licensing
direct from Blancco.  The integrated product is Blancco LUN Eraser.

.. note:: RackN licenses do not entitle use of the Blancco LUN Eraser product.


Overview of Usage
=================

This plugin requires external third party licenses to be purchased from Blancco
to operate correctly.  Product information and purchasing details can be found
on Blancco's website at:

  * https://www.blancco.com/products/lun-eraser/

By default this plugin utilizes the Blancco Cloud services to validate and consume
licenses, and upload completed Reports to.  The operator must have a valid Blancco
Cloud account username and password with license entitlements.  The Blancco Management
Console can be found at:

  * https://cloud.blancco.com/

It is possible to install a local (eg for "air gap" requirements) Blancco License
and Console management service internally.  Contact Blancco for further details.


Basic Usage
+++++++++++

By default this content will not wipe any disks without a number of Params being
set correctly on a target Machine.  An example Profile can be found under Profiles,
which provides a sample of Params that should be set.  The example profile is named:

  * ``blancco-lun-eraser-EXAMPLE``

.. note:: The default EXAMPLE does **not** include the Profile based wipe report
          aggregating.  To enable it, set ``ble/wipe-report-profile-tag`` on the Machine(s).

Specifically, the following required Params must be set with values:

  * ``ble/username`` - The Blancco Cloud or local Console server user account
  * ``ble/password`` - The Blancco Cloud or local Console server user password
  * ``ble/disks`` - an array of disk targets to wipe, each disk consumes 1 (one) Blancco license entitlement
  * ``ble/wipe-disks`` - set to ``true`` to enable disk wiping

Optional configuration Params can be set; if no value is specified, the default value
will be used:

  * ``ble/license-server`` - defaults to ``https://cloud.blancco.com:443``
  * ``ble/wipe-level`` - defaults to ``16: NIST 800-88 Clear``
  * ``ble/wipe-report-profile-tag`` - no default - if set, enables aggregate Machine wipe reports written to a single Profile

The Blancco LUN Eraser tooling supports several standards for different wipe
level requirements.  See the ``ble/wipe-level`` Param documentation for specific
standards supported wipe levels and setting values.


Workflows
+++++++++

The Blancco LUN Eraser (BLE) tasks must be run in Sledgehammer.  The following
Workflow enforces that the machine is in Sledgehammer, then runs the Blancco
LUN Eraser tooling:

  * ``blancco-lun-eraser``


Reporting for Disk Wipes
++++++++++++++++++++++++

When utilizing the Blancco Cloud Management Console, completed wipe reports
may be uploaded to the Console for review and certification proof of disk wipe
operations.  From time-to-time, the reports may fail to upload.  In the case of
a report upload failure, Digital Rebar Platform (DRP) will not fail the Task.
The Job Log for the task will record the failure as a "500" error in the log.

Additionally, DRP records wipe results in the Blancco native Reporting format (XML)
as Params on the Machine, and *optionally*, in a Profile with an aggregate report
grouped together by an operator specified ``tag`` value.  This allows multiple
Machines to execute wipe operations, and aggregate the wipe reports together
in a single Profile.

A completed Wipe Report will be recorded on the Machine object of each Machine
that completes a successful wipe.  The wipe report will be recorded in the
Param:

  * ``ble/wipe-report``

The Optional Profile based aggregate reports must be explicitly enabled, if desired.
To enable the Profile based reports, you must set the following Param with a
"*tag*" value to identify this group of wipe operations.  The tag is an arbitrary
string, but should not contain any special characters.  An example value setting:

  * ``ble/wipe-report-profile-tag``: "20210417-green"

In the above example a Profile will be created and the "*tag*" appended, creating
a report Profile named:

  * ``ble-wipe-report-20210417-green``

This Profile will be added to each machine.  Each machines specific wipe report
will be written as a separate Param in the Profile, with the Machines *UUID* value
as the Param name, prefixed with ``machine-``.

.. note:: Reports are in Blannco's native reporting file format, which is XML.

To remove the report, you must remove the Profile from the Machine(s), then remove
the Profile.

.. warning:: Subsequent re-runs of the ``blancco-lun-eraser`` Workflow, with the
             **same** Profile *tag* will cause older wipe records for a given Machine
             (if they exist), to be delete prior to the new Wipe Report being recorded.


Virtual Machines
++++++++++++++++

If you are using Virtual Machines and wiping disk volumes, note that any of the erase
levels implemented by Blancco LUN Eraser will cause the disk to inflate to it's
fully specified size.  This is an important consideration if you are backing your
disk volumes as Sparse type disks.  You must ensure that your backing storage for
your Virtual Machine volumes is large enough for the disks to be fully inflated.
