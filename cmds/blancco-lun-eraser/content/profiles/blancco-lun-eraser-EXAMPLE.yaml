Description: 'An EXAMPLE profile for use of Blancco LUN Eraser wipe tool.'
Documentation: |
  This is an EXAMPLE profile that can be used as a starting point for use
  of the Blancco LUN Eraser (BLE) integration.

  To use it, clone it and change values accordingly.  Each Param contains
  appropriate documentation for use.

  .. warning:: The ``ble/skip`` Param is a safety check, it must be set
               to ``false`` to execute the disk wiping procedures.  By setting
               this value, the system will irrevocably NUKE all data on the
               disks.  That's what this tool does.
