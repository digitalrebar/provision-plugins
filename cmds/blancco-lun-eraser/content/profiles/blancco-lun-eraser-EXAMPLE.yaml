Name: blancco-lun-eraser-EXAMPLE
Description: 'An EXAMPLE profile for use of Blancco LUN Eraser wipe tool.'
Documentation: |
  This is an EXAMPLE profile that can be used as a starting point for use
  of the Blancco LUN Eraser (BLE) integration.

  To use it, clone it and change values accordingly.  Each Param contains
  appropriate documentation for use.

  .. warning:: The ``ble/wipe-disks`` Param is a safety check, it must be set
               to ``true`` to execute the disk wiping procedures.  By setting
               this value, the system will irrevocably NUKE all data on the
               disks.  That's what this tool does.

  The optional Param ``ble/wipe-report-profile-tag`` is *not* set in this
  example profile.  If you are wiping multiple Machines and would like an
  aggregated report collected in a single Profile, then review the documentation
  for the Param.
