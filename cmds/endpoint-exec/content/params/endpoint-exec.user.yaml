  If this param is empty (the default), the action will have its RS_TOKEN
  set to the one the plugin has, giving it nearly unlimited
  authority.  If this param is set to 'asMachine', the task will run
  with a machine token equivalent to one that the machine would have
  while running a task.  Otherwise, this param must be set to a username
  that exists, and the action will be run with a token that contains the
  same authority that user has.
