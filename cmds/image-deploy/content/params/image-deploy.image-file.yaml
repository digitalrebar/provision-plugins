Name: "image-deploy/image-file"
Description: "The image file for image-deploy to use."
Documentation: |
  The file image for image-deploy to install.  This will have the Provisioner's
  URL prepended to the filename.

  You may use the ``drpcli isos upload ...`` command to place an image into the system.
  If this method is used, please prepend 'isos/' to your filename.  You **MUST NOT**
  have any other directories in the filename; they must reside in the base ``isos/`` directory.

    * example: ``isos/centos-7.tgz``

  You may use the ``drpcli files upload ...`` command to place an image into the system.
  If this method is used, prepend 'files/' to your filename. You **MAY** use
  additional directories in the filename.

    * example:  ``files/images/windows/windows-server-2019.raw.gz``

  You may also just place the image file under the DRP tftpboot directory.
  If this method is used, use the path relative to the tftpboot directory.

    * example: ``my_dir/some_stuff/ubuntu.tgz``

  In the above example, this *might* resolve to the following path on the Digital Rebar Platform
  filesystem, based on a default "production" install type:

    * ``/var/lib/dr-provision/tftpboot/my_dir/some_stuff/``
