Name: "image-deploy/install-disk"
Description: "The disk curtin should install upon"
Documentation: |
  The disk that the image-deploy system should install to.  The default value
  is ``/dev/sda``.  If the disks in the system are iterated with different device
  names, then you must adjust this Param appropriately.  For example, virtual
  machines may iterate their disks to the Sledgehammer environment as ``/dev/vda``,
  so you would set this Param value to ``/dev/vda`` in that case.

  For troubleshooting, boot the Machine in to Sledgehammer (eg via the ``discover-base``
  workflow; or any other appropriate workflow), and use ``lsblk`` to iterate and identify
  the device names of the disks.
