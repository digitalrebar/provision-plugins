Name: "esxi-set-network-protocol"
Description: "Set the ESXi network protocol (IPv4 / IPv6 / both) versions supported on the system."
Documentation: |
  Sets the supported IP protocol suites supported on the ESXi system.  Supported
  values are:

    * ``both`` - (default) Support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
    * ``ipv4`` - support ONLY the IPv4 protocol, and disable IPv6 support completely
    * ``ipv6`` - enable IPv6 protocol if not currently on (IPv4 can not be disabled in ESXi)

  .. warning:: Changing IPv4 or IPv6 requires an ESXi reboot - and may disconnect
               the ESXI node from the network.  This Task does not validate desired
               protocol state connectivity after changes are made.  Ensure you have
               appropriate IP addressing in place for continued network connectivity.

  If the ``esxi/set-network-protocol-skip-reboot`` Param is set to ``true``, the
  operator is responsible to reboot the ESXi node to implement any protocol changes.
