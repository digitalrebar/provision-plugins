Name: "esxi-install-certificate"
Description: "Install SSL Certificate"
Documentation: |
  Install SSL Certificate.  Uses the ``esxi/ssl-key`` and ``esxi/ssl-certificate`` Params
  to specify a custom certificate.

  If the ``esxi/regenerate-certificates`` is set, then the self-signed certificate will be
  automatically regenerated.  By defaul the initial self-signed certificate will often be
  created with "*localhost.localdomain*" (or similar).  If certificate regeneration is
  performed by this task, then the self-signed certificate will be built based on the
  FQDN of the ESXi host.

  Specifying explicit key/certificeate to install is mutually exclussive to also setting
  the regenerate method.  If both options are specified, the explicit key/certificate will
  be installed and regeneration of a self-signed certificate will be skipped.
