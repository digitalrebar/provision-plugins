Name: esxi/network-firstboot-vmnic
Description: ESXi network device name for the first boot (installed) OS environment.
Documentation: |
  Use this param to specify the device to plumb the network configuration up
  with post install in the installed OS after the Kickstart runs.  This Param does
  not have a default value; existing code will assume the product default behavior of
  using *vmnic0* if this Param is not set.

  If the Param ``esxi/vmnic-device`` is set, that Param takes precendence over this
  one.  This retains backwards compatability in the field for existing content.

  Setting a value on this Param other than the default of ``vmnic0`` has the following
  effects in ESXi:

    * Link the new ``vmnic`` device in to the default ``vSwitch0`` Virtual Switch
    * Remove the ``vmnic0`` device (unlink) from ``vSwitch0``
    * restart the network IP stack in ESXi

  For more complex network topology changes, please see the ``vmware-lib`` Content Pack.
