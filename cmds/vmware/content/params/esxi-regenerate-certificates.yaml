Description: "Regenerate the self-signed certificates if requested"
Documentation: |
  This Param will force ESXi to regenerate the self-signed certificates.
  It is used in the ``esxi-install-certificates`` task.

  The ESXi hostname may change, or the certificate may have only been
  generated initially with HOSTNAME.

  The default action is to **NOT** regenerate the certificates.
