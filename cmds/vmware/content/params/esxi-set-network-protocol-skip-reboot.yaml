Name: esxi/set-network-protocol-skip-reboot
Description: Skips required reboot if IP protocol suite change requires it.
Documentation: |
  Setting this Param value to ``true`` will force the Task ``esxi-set-network-protocol``
  to **NOT** reboot as required to implement the change.  Presumably the operator
  intends to reboot the ESXi node at a later date/time.

  .. warning:: IP protocol suite changes require a system reboot to implement; the
               ``services.sh`` or down/up of interfaces does NOT implement the IP
               protocol suite changes.

  Skipping the reboot (value set to ``true``) will not implement the protocol state
  change until the system is rebooted by some OTHER task or method.
