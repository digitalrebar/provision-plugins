Name: esxi/disk-install-override

Description: "Allow overriding the 'install' disk with a specific strategy."
Documentation: |
  Some hardware (namely HPE with "Smart" Array controllers do not iterate
  the disks smartly.  This causes the ESXi install strategy to fail when
  the RAID controller is specified as a RAID 1 device with passthrough mode
  for the remainder of the devices.  ESXi does not build an appropriate
  device type for us to handle with the `--disk=mpx.vmhb0:...` strategy.

  This Param will override the ESXi Kickstart `install ...` directive and
  select a given supported strategy for finding the disk to install to.

  The currently supported install directives are defined below:

    ======================  ======================================================
    directive               notes
    ======================  ======================================================
    first_disk              Sets the install disk target to the default value of
                            '--firstdisk'.  Primarily useful only for testing the
                            code path of this content, since this is the default
                            behavior if nothing else is specified.
    find_first_naa          Selects the first device that is iterated in the
                            /vmfs/devices/disks directory, with the name beginning
                            with 'naa.*'
    find_first_dellboss_vd  Sets disk to first JBOSS Virtual Disk on Dell systems.
    find_disk_name          Sets disk to the first pattern matched by the first
                            argument to the function
    ======================  ======================================================

  find_disk_name MUST be called with an additional argument that is a pattern.
  An example value is:

    ::

      find_disk_name '*disk.v1*'


  Using the above listed strategies will set the Kickstart `install` command
  as follows:

    ::

      install --disk=<FOUND_DEVICE>

  If other `install` options need to be specified (eg `--overwritevmfs`),
  you must also set those as the Param `esxi/disk-install-override-options`
  and they will be appended to the above example `install` command.  Here
  is an example:

    ::

      # with 'esxi/disk-install-override-options' set to '--overwritevmfs'
      # the 'install' command will be built up as follows:

      install --disk=/vmfs/devices/disks/naa.60... --overwritevmfs

  .. note: Other override strategies may be added as additional in-the-field requirements dictate.


  Note that custom functions can be injected in to the template to support
  strategies that are not directly released with this content.  This allows
  for custom in-the-field templates to be built, and injected in to the
  DRP endpoint to support new "strategies" as needed.

  If new strategies are developed/used, please contact RackN to help ensure
  these are added in to standard product so field customizations are not
  necessary.

  The Param type definition does not include an `enum: ...` list as custom
  strategies may be injected via the `esxi/disk-install-override-custom`
  Param.
