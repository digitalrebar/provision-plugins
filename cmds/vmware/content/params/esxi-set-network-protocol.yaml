Name: esxi/set-network-protocol
Description: Set the ESXi network protocol.
Documentation: |
  This param controls what IP protocol suite is enabled on the ESXi node.
  By default, both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled on ESXi.

  This Param can be set to:

    * both (the default)
    * ipv4
    * ipv6

  If the Param is set to ``ipv4``, the IPv6 protocol will be disabled.

  .. note:: Setting the value to ``ipv6`` will not actually disable the
            IPv4 protocol suite.  VMware has NOT implemented this mode.
            Please contact VMware for any questions around this policy.

  In the future, should the IPv4 protocol suite be allowed to be disabled,
  this Task will be updated to reflect that capability.  In the meantime,
  IPv4 will always be enabled.
