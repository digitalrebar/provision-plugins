VMware vSphere Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection of tools for managing VMware vSphere ESXi nodes via Digital
Rebar Provision (DRP) workflows and content.  This plugin provides content
and pieces for managing ESXi infrastrcuture.  In addition to standard
VMware release BootEnvs for various ESXi versions, custom vendor BootEnvs
are also included.

VMware vSphere ESXi installs can be highly customized via the use of DRPs
templating constructs to create a complex Kickstart that is capable of
doing deep configuration of the ESXi node.


Overview of Usage
-----------------

Starting in the VMware plugin version 2.9.0 and newer, there is a much
simplified Workflow use pattern.  Previously, there were several
Workflows and Stages that were each used for a specific version of the
VMware ISO to be installed.  This created a sprawling mess.

Starting with v2.9.0 plugin - you now have only one example Workflow and
stage that uses a set of Params to define what to deploy to your machines.
In addition, you can let the system select a default version based on the
the Classification Vendor/Model information of your machines, by use of
a Map.

.. note:: WARNING:  Moving to the v2.9.0 version plugin will require some
          manual upgrade steps.  Please see the UPGRADE notes below.


Basic Usage
===========

For basic usage, and to obtain the latest VMware generic ISO BootEnv
installation, simply use the ``esxi-install`` workflow.

.. note:: The 'esxi-install' workflow must be run in the Sledgehammer (Discovery) image environment to transition the Machine to the appropriate ESXi bootenv installation.

.. note:: The first stage of the workflow is 'prep-install' which WILL WIPE the disks in preparation of the installation.

This workflow uses the following Params:

  - **vmware/esxi-version**: set to ``select-vendor``, or to a precise
    BootEnv that exists on the system (eg ``esxi_670u2-13006603_vmware``),
    this is an ``enum`` type of curated an supported BootEnvs by RackN
  - **vmware/esxi-version-override**: if the curated list of BootEnvs does not
    support your needs (you've installed custom BootEnvs), then setting this
    value will override the ``enum`` list in ``vmware/esxi-version`` - the
    specified BootEnv must exist, be valid, and the ISO contents exploded
    and available somewhere
  - **vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map**: this is a mapping of which BootEnv to
    use by default when a machine Vendor and Model has been automatically
    Classified - it allows for single workflows to address heterogeneous
    pools of hardware - see the Param documentation below for more details
  - **esxi/patch-map**: allows the operator to specify additional patches to
    install after the BootEnv is installed via the ISO contents - this is useful
    for VMware Cloud Foundation (vCF) HCL compliance installations that require
    additional patch levels be installed in preparation for vCF cluster builds.

Please review below documentation for additional details on the above pieces.


Advanced Usage
==============

Setting the ``vmware/esxi-version`` Param to ``select-vendor`` will enable
automatic selection of the ISO based on the Vendor and Model (if appropriate)
of the hardware, dynamically.  This pattern allows operators to have a pool
of heterogenous hardware, and map VMware ESXi ISO versions to the vendors,
allowing for appropriate custom vendor ISOs to be used for each hardware
type.

This map is maintained in the ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map``, which carries
a default set defined by RackN.  Should you want to specify precise versions
to use, you can set this Param to a map structure of your choosing.  Set this
directly on the Machine as a Param, or via Profiles that are added to the
machine (including ``global``, if appropriate).

Patching ESXi Systems at Install Time
=====================================

The RackN VMware plugin also supports applying a patch version to the base install
ISO at installation time.  The patching system relies on two separate sets of
maps to specify where to find the Patches and related information (the
``esxi/patch-map``, and the actual patch to install (via the ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map``
param).

The Patch Map defines the patch name based on the VMware "Build Number", which
also serves as the index for the URL location, hash to validate the patch, and
an optional custom location for finding the patch.  Please see the individual
``esxi/patch-*`` named Params for more details.

VMware maintains their patch download URLs behind a CGI gateway that does not
expose a direct download URL link.  RackN can not provide a direct download
link in the individual Patch download locations.  Please follow the below
steps to acquire patches:

  * go to: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/patch#search
  * login with your VMware account
  * select "ESXi (Embedded and Installable)"
  * select the version of ESXi that the patch applies to
  * then in the "Enter Build Number" - put the build number ID which can be referenced in the ``esxi/patch-map`` Param
  * hit search
  * you'll get a table of results - cross reference the correct Build ID - and click on the "Download" button they provide
  * send a gentle note to VMware to modernize their download process

Adding Custom BootEnvs (VMware ESXi versions)
=============================================

At RackN, we try to keep up with the latest set of VMware ESXi versions, but
the reality is ... we won't succeed.  As such, you may need to inject new
BootEnvs in to the system, which support your specific Vendor and/or VMware
ESXi version needs.  This content pack supports adding in new BootEnvs (VMware
ESXi versions), and using the above set of Params and Workflow control to
deploy them to your machines.

There are two paths for installing new ESXi versions:

  1.  Creating a new content pack with all of the trimmings - there is a shell
      script named ``esxi-make-content-pack.sh`` that should exist in your
      ``tftpboot`` directory.  It builds full content packs of VMware ISOs.
      See the script of usage, or contact your RackN support team for more
      details.  NOTE NOTE NOTE: usage of this tool does NOT ALLOW for the
      advanced Param based workflows described above - however, the content
      pack will be completely separated from the RackN distributed plugin.

  2.  Injecting just the minimal ``bootenv`` and ESXi specific ``boot.cfg``
      content pieces.  In your ``tftpboot`` directory there should be a
      shell script named ``make-esxi-bootenvs.sh``.  This script builds a
      RackN BootEnv and subsequent ``boot.cfg`` template needed, following
      our naming structure.  This method is fully supported for extending
      the VMware plugin to add additional BootEnv (VMware ESXi Versions)
      to the system.

.. note:: Both of the above referenced scripts are only available in Digital
          Rebar Provision v3.13.7 or v3.14.0 and newer.  If you need these
          scripts outside of those environments, contact your RackN support
          team, as they can be made available.

.. note:: IF YOU NEED VERSIONS WE HAVE NOT ADDED ... please contact RackN,
          we would like to keep this content plugin as up to date as possible
          with our customer requirements.  We will continue to add new
          versions as we can.  You will receive the benefit of this content
          being "off-the-shelf" and not requiring additional custom content
          to support ESXi environments.

.. _vmware_esxi_passwords:

Managing Your ESXi Passwords
----------------------------

There are a few options you have for setting/defining the password(s) that
are set on your installed ESXi instance.

During the ESXi installer process (kickstart/weasel), the shell (Alt-F1) is
the stock/standard ESXi set (user "root", no password).

If you take no actions, the default password will follow all standard bootenv
passwords see :ref:`rs_default_password` for details.

To set custom passwords, you have the following options, the items listed first,
will take precedence over subsequent items:

  1. Set the ``provisioner-default-password-hash`` to a SHA512 sum value.
  2. Use the ``esxi/insecure-password`` Param set on a machine (directly or via
     a Profile), with a clear text password.  This will be converted to a
     SHA512 hash and fed to weasel for the installed ESXi password.
  3. You can have the system dynamically generate a random VMware formatted
     valid password for every single ESXi instance installed.  To use this, set
     the param ``esxi/generate-random-password`` to ``true``.  This can only
     be run as a preparatory stage in Sledgehammer.

The generate random use case is designed to allow your infrastructure to have secure
per-machine passwords.  The expectation is that you will move these in to a centrally
managed secrets system (eg vault or password keeper) for consumption by other
automated systems.

Please see the per-Param documentation below for more details on the above methods.


NOTES ON UPGRADING To v2.9.0 Plugin
-----------------------------------

The new version selector features are being released in the plugin version
v2.9.0.  If you have used the previous v2.8.0 or older versions, you will
need to perform some basic maintenance to install this version, as there
are incompatible changes.  Below are some notes related to the upgrade.  If
you run in to issues, please contact RackN as quickly as possible, don't
waste your time trying to sort it out.

  1.  Remove all ``vmware/esxi-version`` Params from your Machines or
      profiles.  The naming structure of the BootEnvs has changed to be
      more structured and predictable.  This causes the Param ``enum``
      structure from the OLD versions to NOT BE COMPATIBLE with the new.
  2.  Your "exploded" BootEnvs on disk or in your ``esxi/http-mirror``
      location needs to change.  If you are not using the http mirror
      method, you can simply delete the ``tftpboot/esxi-*` directories
      relating to your existing ISOs, then restart the DRP service.
  3.  Insure your original ISOs still exist in the ``tftpboot/isos/``
      directory, for them to be re-exploded to the new BootEnv names.
  4.  Remove the existing VMware plugin, then add the new one - do not
      perform an upgrade/install of it.

Generally speaking we try to avoid, impacting upgrades like this with content,
but sometimes there are compelling reasons to make breaking changes.  In this
case we move to a much cleaner and easier to support method for deploying
ESXi, gain incredibly powerful auto-magic deployments based on hardware vendor,
and simplify and standardize the naming structure of the BootEnvs.

DEPRECATED BOOTENVS
===================

To support a successful upgrade from the v2.8.0 to v2.9.0 vmware plugin, the
old BootEnv names must be mainatined.  If they are referenced via Workflow
or as configuration on Machine Objects, or other places in the system, you
will not be able to successfully update to the v2.9.0 plugin version.

The following list of BootEnvs are considered deprecated, and will be removed
in a future release.  Probably very very soon (v2.10.0 plugin versions).  You
must change any references to the following BootEnvs in your DRP endpoint,
prior to your next upgrade:

  * esxi-550u3b
  * esxi-6.7.0-update1-10302608-custom-hitachi_0200_Blade_HA8000
  * esxi-6.7.0-update1-10302608-custom-hitachi_1200_HA8000VGen10
  * esxi-6.7.1-10302608-nec-6.702
  * esxi-6.7.1-10302608-nec-gen-6.7
  * esxi-600u2
  * esxi-600u3a
  * esxi-650a
  * esxi-650u2
  * esxi-670
  * esxi-670u1
  * esxi-670u2
  * esxi-dellemc-esxi-6.5u2-10719125a07
  * esxi-dellemc-esxi-6.7u1-10764712-a04
  * esxi-fujitsu-vmvisor-installer-6.7-10
  * esxi-hpe-esxi-6.7.0-update1-iso-gen9p
  * esxi-lenovo_esxi6.7u1-10302608_201810
  * esxi-vmware-esxi-6.7.0-10302608-custom-cisco

The new bootenv naming scheme is designed to be more machine parsable, and no
longer uses the vendor ISO meta information as it is wildly inconsistent and
sucks.

The replacement BootEnv names are below, and you should be able to determine the
mappings between the names.

  * esxi_550u3b-3248547_vmware
  * esxi_600u2-3620759_vmware
  * esxi_600u3a-5572656_vmware
  * esxi_650a-4887370_vmware
  * esxi_650u1-7388607_hpe

  * esxi_670u2-13981272-A02_dell
  * esxi_670u2-13981272_lenovo

.. note:: There may be many more bootenv names than listed above, if support
          for newer vendor ISOs and/or VMware versions are released.

.. note:: It is advisable to use the 'esxi-install' Workflow and the
          'esxi/select-version-map' Param to control your ESXi bootenv
          installation.

ESXi Agent/Runner Information
-----------------------------

VMware ESXi environments are for the most part "closed appliances", and
compiling third party tools for these environments is not an easy process.
Consequently, the Golang based compiled Agent/Runner (``drpcli``) can not
be cross compiled to run in the ESXi operating environment.  RackN does
build and maintain a Python3 capable Agent/Runner to support Workflow
operations in the ESXi install environment (Weasel kickstart) and as a
post-installed Agent for executing Workflow in installed systems.

There are two primary components that must be installed to support
Workflow in the ESXi environment:

  * DRPY ("derpy") Agent - an ESXi VIB module - installs the Python3
    based tools to support Workflow/Stage execution
  * Firewall-VIB - an ESXi VIB module - enables persistent firewall
    port access from the installed ESXi environment to the DRP API
    port

If you are using the Workflow system to mark machines as "complete" for
install tracking purposes, you must also set the ``esxi/skip-notify`` Param
value to ``true``.

To install the ESXi Agent/Runner, you must also install the Firewall-VIB
module, or arrange to disable the ESXi built-in firewall system.  Please
see the ``esxi-install-agent` Stage.

Adding Custom Kickstart Sections
================================

Digital Rebar Provision provides on-the-fly customization of the built Kickstart
through the use of injecting Templates in to the core Kickstart file, and also
providing dynamic information available on the DRP endpoint, in to the Templates.

.. note:: It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use the RackN Workflow and Stages to add
  customizations to the install process, and to  NOT INJECT custom kickstart
  templates.  Please see the "ESXI Agent/Runner Information" section.

ESXi kickstarts support three additional sections (or phases) that extra
actions can be taken during the installation process:

  Pre Stage (``%pre``)
    Specifies a script to run before the kickstart configuration is evaluated. For example, you can use it to generate files for the kickstart file to include.

  ESXi Installation Stage
    Uses Kickstart for automating the installation; see `Vmware Kickstart Documentation <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-61A14EBB-5CF3-43EE-87EF-DB8EC6D83698.html>`_ for more details.

  Post Stage (``%post``)
    Runs the specified script after package installation is complete. If you specify multiple %post sections, they run in the order that they appear in the installation script.

  Firstboot Stage (``%firstboot``)
    Creates an init script that runs only during the first boot. The script has no effect on subsequent boots. If multiple %firstboot sections are specified, they run in the order that they appear in the kickstart file.

DRP's "vmware" content allows you to inject custom ``%pre``, ``%post``, and
``%firstboot`` scripts in to your installation kickstart.  It is up to the
operator to understand the ordering and proper usage of these scripts.

To do so, simply create Templates with your Kickstart snippets defined as you
desire.  Then use the ``esxi/ks-custom-sections`` Param structure to include
the appropriate scripts in your kickstart.  NOTE:  the ``%pre`` ``%post`` and
``%firstboot`` separators will be injected into the Kickstart file for you (*do
NOT include them in the template*).

Example Param definition:

  ::

      ##############
      # YAML example
      # see WARNING note about kickstart below

      - "pre-busybox"
        - "my-pre-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"
        - "my-pre-busybox-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
      - "post-python"
        - "my-post-python3-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
      - "firstboot-busybox"
        - "my-fistboot-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"


      ##############
      # JSON example
      # see WARNING note about kickstart below

      {
        "firstboot-busybox": [
          "my-fistboot-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"
        ],
        "post-python": [
          "my-post-python3-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        ],
        "pre-busybox": [
          "my-pre-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl",
          "my-pre-busybox-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        ]
      }

.. note:: None of the above reference templates exist in this plugin.  You must create them as appropriate for your use cases.

You may also create templates that carry kickstart command directives,
to customize the main body of the kickstart.  Use the ``esxi/ks-custom-kickstart`
param to specify the additional templates with kickstart directives to
inject.  These will be placed after the ``esxi-network-ks.tmpl``, but before
any of the ``%pre``, ``%post``, and/or ``%firstboot`` ections are injected.

Example:

  ::

    esxi/ks-custom-kickstart:
      - my-kickstart-chunk1.ks.tmpl

The above examples will generate a kickstart that looks similar to below:

  ::

    # DRP provided kickstart opening statements
    <template default statements go here>

    # DRP provided network configuration template
    <esxi-network-ks.tmpl>

    # example "kickstart" customization template
    <my-kickstart-chunk1.ks.tmpl>

    # DRP provided kickstart template pre/post/firstboot "stock" sections
    <esxi-notify-drp-py3.tmpl>
    <esxi-preserve-logs.tmpl>
    <esxi-enable-shells.tmpl>

    # example custom sections to add
    # firstboot-busybox
    %pre --interpreter=busybox
    <my-firstboot-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl>

    # post-python
    %pre --interpreter=python
    <my-post-python3-chunk2.ks.tmpl>

    # pre-busybox
    %pre --interpreter=busybox
    <my-pre-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl>
    <my-pre-busybox-chunk2.ks.tmpl>

Network Configuration Options
-----------------------------

The VMware plugin from RackN supports managing relatively complex network
scenarious around your VMware ESXi infrastructure.  There are three places
within the provisioning stages that network configuration changes can be
made to support different operational models.

The three primary configuration points for network settings are explained
below.  In all cases, we assume that the PXE start process is assigned
an IP address from your DHCP infrastructure - either from Digital Rebar
Provision itself, or other external DHCP services.

1. Initial kernel network configuration.  Initial DHCP/PXE services may be
   on an isolated network from the provisioning networks.  These settings
   are controlled by passing values to the kernel at initial load time,
   via use of the ``kernel-options`` parameter.

   An example:

      ``ip=10.10.10.10 netmask=255.255.255.0 gateway=10.10.10.1 vlan=10``

2. Once the initial kernel has booted, the kickstart environment can be
   plumbed with a set of network configuration options.  See the
   ``esxi/network-kickstart-type`` Param documentation for details on
   configuring the network at this stage.

3. Once a machine has finished installing, and subsequently boots in to
   it's installed operating system; it is possible to again specify
   different network configurations.

   This may be necessary in the case of a Provisioning network transition
   to a Production network configuration post-install.

   To customize the network configuration post-install, please see the
   ``esxi/network-firstboot-type`` parameter for options.

Some sample scenarios and how you need to configure for those use cases
are listed below.

Simple DHCP Only Setup
======================

If you are trying to simply obtain a DHCP configuration at boot time,
and preserve that IP through the install and frist boot of the installed
OS, you do not need to do anything.  The default behavior will be to
obtain DHCP and preserve it through the install.

DHCP on PXE; Configure Manual IP (kickstart and installed OS)
=============================================================

If you intend to acquire an IP address during initial PXE boot of the
Machine, but then transition to a Static (manually) configured network
configurutation during the Kickstart installation and as the final
installed network config, use the following steps:

1. Do not set any values for ``kernel-options``
2. Set the ``esxi/network-kickstart-type`` appropriately
3. Follow the documentation for that Param.

DHCP ON PXE; Retain for Kickstart; Installed OS Different
=========================================================

If your provisioning network is defined by the PXE DHCP network configuration,
but you wish to transfer the installed OS (on first boot), to a new
network configuration, use the following setps:

1. Do not set any values for ``kernel-options``
2. Set the ``esxi/network-firstboot-type`` appropriately
3. Follow the documentation for that Param.

VLAN Tagged Interfaces
======================

VLAN tagged frames can be set at any of the three primary stages of the
provisioning process outlined above.  Set the appropriate options for
either of the following stages:

Kernel boot/kickstart VLAN tagged
  Set the ``kernel-options`` param to include the ``vlan=N`` setting, where
  **N** is the VLAN ID from ``1`` to ``4096``.

Kickstart Network and/or Firstboot Network VLAN tagged
  Set the Param ``esxi/network-*-vlan`` Param for the appropriate
  stage.

Packet MTU Size
===============

Custom MTU (maximum transmission unit) frame sizes for packets can be set.  This
is for the Management Network (eg "vmnic0"/"vmk0") MTU setting.  To set the MTU
size, set the following Param to your specified value:

  - ``esxi/network-firstboot-mtu``

  .. note:: The MTU size setting change currently is only supported for the
            "firstboot" (final installed) stage of the configuraiont; it is
            not supported during the kickstart/weasel install process.


DNS, Search Domains, NTP Settings
=================================

To customize network configurations for DNS and NTP settings, please see
the ``drp-community-content`` Params:

  - ``dns-servers``
  - ``ntp-servers``
  - ``dns-search-domains``

Additionally, a custom NTP configuration template can be provided to
completely override the (relatively simplistic) default NTP settings
supported by this content.  To override the template follow the below
steps:

1. Create a new Template with your NTP configuration.

2. (optional) You can use the existing ``ntp-servers`` Param similarly to
   the RackN supplied content, by reviewing the following example.

  ::

    restrict default kod nomodify notrap noquerynopeer
    restrict 127.0.0.1
    {{range $key, $ntp := .Param "ntp-servers" -}}
    server {{ $ntp }} iburst
    {{end -}}

3. Set the ``esxi-ntp-conf` Param with the name of your NTP template you
   created above.

Licensing ESXI During Install
-----------------------------

Use the ``esxi/license`` Parameter to set a License to be used during installation
to enable licensed use of ESXi.


**The following documentation defines the various components of the vmware
content and how to use them.**


Various Error Messages You May See
----------------------------------

If you are regularly installing ESXi systems and observing the installation from the
systems console (keyboard, video, mouse, etc.), you may observe a few error messages
that the Weasel installer kicks out.  These are considered "normal" and are documented
here just in case you go looking for them.

Deleting vmk0 Management Interface
==================================

Error Message:

  ::

    Deleting vmk0 Management Interface, so setting advIface to NULL

*Explanation:*

  This is generally a non fatal issue, and due to forcing override on the
  default gateway during the Weasel installation configuration stages.  You
  should be able to safely ignore this error.

Validation Disabled
===================

Error Message:

  ::

    Attempting to install an image profile with validation disabled.  This may result
    in an image with unsatisfied dependencies, file or package conflicts, and potential
    security violations.


*Explanation:*

  VMware VIBs (software installer bundles) have four levels of "trusted" levels.  Currently,
  the RackN Firewall and DRPY Agent VIB are set at ``CommunitySupported`` level. This means
  that if the ESXi system is installed to accept software any higher level, then this message
  will be displayed.

  RackN is a Partner with VMware, however, we do not have certifications for these packages
  yet.  Until then, you'll have to live with this error message.

  For more details on VMware *Acceptance Levels*, please see:

    * https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-0410FAFA-A007-4BD5-A0CC-B1D7303853A3.html

Scratch Partition Location
==========================

Error Message:

  ::

    Logs are stored on a non-persistent storage.  Consult product documentation to configure a
    syslog server or a scratch partition.

*Explanation:*

  This is an expected message due to the installer (Weasel) architecture.  The installation
  is performed from a memory backed filesystem, and any installer logs are written to this
  location.  When you reboot, the installer logs are nuked.

  To preserve the logs, RackN copies them to ``/vmfs/volumes/datastore1/install-logs/`` for
  post-install review if there are any questions on the installer actions, or errors in the
  installation.

  At some future point, these logs may be forwarded to the Endpoint and accessible within the
